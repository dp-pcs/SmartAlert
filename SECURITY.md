We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in SmartAlert, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to avoid potential exploitation.

### 2. Report the vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities to our security team at:
- **Email**: info@proctorconsultingservices.com
- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] SmartAlert - [Brief Description]`

### 3. Include the following information

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact of the vulnerability
- **Environment**: OS, Python version, and any relevant configuration
- **Proof of concept**: If available, include a minimal proof of concept
- **Suggested fix**: If you have suggestions for fixing the issue

### 4. Response timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: As quickly as possible, typically within 30 days

### 5. Disclosure policy

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- We will provide regular updates on the progress of fixing the vulnerability
- Once the vulnerability is fixed, we will:
  - Release a security update
  - Credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
  - Update the changelog and release notes
